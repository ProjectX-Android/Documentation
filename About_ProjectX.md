With ProjectX, the successor of CyanHacker, we are trying to start a project that aims to provide an awesome User Experience all over the place. Whilst most other ROMS trying to provide as many features as possible, we want to develop a ROM which is clean, fast, well maintained and optimized and has some of the greatest, most useful cherry-picks.
ProjectX is based on CM and packed with Optimizations and improvements on the Experiments.
Our goal: Provide the best Android experience avaiable
