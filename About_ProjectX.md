# Building ProjectX

With ProjectX, the successor of CyanHacker, we are starting a project that aims to provide an awesome User Experience all over the place. Whilst most other ROMS try to provide as many features as possible, we want to develop a ROM which is clean, fast, well maintained, optimized and has some of the greatest, most useful cherry-picks.
ProjectX is based on CM and packed with Optimizations and improvements on your experience.
**Our goal:** ***Provide the best Android experience avaiable.***
