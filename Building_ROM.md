# Building ProjectX


To get started with ProjectX, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

## Create the Directories

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

* To create them run:

    mkdir -p ~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/px

## Downloading Repo

    curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

## Initialising ProjectX

    cd ~/px
    repo init -u git://github.com/ProjectX-Android/manifest.git -b lollipop-5.1

## Building
