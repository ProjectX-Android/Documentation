# Building ProjectX

To get started with ProjectX, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

## Create the directories

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

* To create them run:

		mkdir -p ~/bin
		mkdir -p ~/px

## Downloading repo

    curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

## Initialising ProjectX

    cd ~/px
    repo init -u git://github.com/ProjectX-Android/manifest.git -b lollipop-5.1
